Ingredients

▢6 large egg yolks
▢1/2 cup granulated sugar
▢1 cup heavy whipping cream
▢2 cups milk
▢1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
▢pinch of salt
▢1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
▢ground cinnamon , for topping 


This eggnog recipe is thick, sweet, creamy and smooth, with the perfect flavor.   It doesn’t contain alcohol (if you’d like to add some, read on for my suggestions), but we are non-alcohol drinkers at my house, and I wanted an eggnog recipe my kids can enjoy too.
How to make eggnog:
Start by whisking the egg yolk and sugar together in a small bowl.  Then, in a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine cream, milk, salt, and nutmeg and stir the mixture until it just reaches a simmer.  Next temper the eggs by adding small spoonfuls of the hot mixture to the egg mix

Stir each spoonful and once most of the hot mixture has been added, add the entire mixture back to the saucepan.  Continue cooking and whisking for just another minute or two until it barely thickens. It will continue to thicken as it cools. Then remove it from the heat and add the vanilla.  Refrigerate the eggnog mixture until chilled.

We like to serve it with a some whipped cream and an extra little dash of cinnamon and nutmeg on top.

Instructions
 
Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a medium bowl until light and creamy.
In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the cream, milk, nutmeg and salt. Stir often until mixture reaches a bare simmer. 
Add a big spoonful of the hot milk to the egg mixture, whisking vigorously. Repeat, adding a big spoonful at a time, to temper the eggs. 
Once most of the hot milk has been added to the eggs, pour the mixture back into the saucepan on the stove.
