Equipment
Fine Mesh Strainer
Instant-read digital thermometer.

Instructions
1.	Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a medium bowl until light and creamy.
2.	In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the cream, milk, nutmeg and salt. Stir often until mixture reaches a bare simmer. 
3.	Add a big spoonful of the hot milk to the egg mixture, whisking vigorously. Repeat, adding a big spoonful at a time, to temper the eggs. 
4.	Once most of the hot milk has been added to the eggs, pour the mixture back into the saucepan on the stove. 
5.	Whisk constantly for a minute or so, until the mixture is just slightly thickened (or until it reaches about 160 degrees F on a thermometer). It will thicken more as it cools.
6.	Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, and alcohol*, if using.
7.	Pour the eggnog through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher or other container and cover with plastic wrap. 
8.	Refrigerate until chilled. It will thicken as it cools. If you want a thinner, completely smooth consistency, you can add the entire mixture to a blender with 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk and blend until smooth.
9.	Serve with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg, and fresh whipped cream, if desired.
10.	Store homemade eggnog in the fridge for up to one week.
